Features:

	- New stats display, view vote/comment ratio, net vote gain per min, and comments per min
	- Internal database now records times

Update Notes:

Because of the database format change, importing 1.0 DB's won't work. Because nobody actually uses this, I haven't written a converter. If you somehow used Beta 1.0 and want a converter message me on reddit or write a request here on git and I'll do it with in 24 hours.
