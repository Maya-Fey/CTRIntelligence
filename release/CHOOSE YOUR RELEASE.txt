Unless you have an explicit reason otherwise, choosing the lastest version is best. The latest version right now is Beta 1.0, although the latest version will always be in a folder called 'latest', alongside a folder with the version name. 

There are three releases in each. One called VERSION.js, one called VERSION-auto.js, and another called VERSION-autoload.js.

The 'auto' version is simply one where it will automatically ask you to import a database when you activate the bookmark. This may save you time depending on your workflow.

The 'autoload' version will automatically load your DB from your browsers' local storage if you have one saved. This variant is not present before Beta 1.4, as the save/load functionality did not exist at the time.

For installation instructions, go to INSTALL.txt on the root directory.
For usage information, go to USAGE.txt on the root directory.
