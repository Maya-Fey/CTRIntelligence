Unless you have an explicit reason otherwise, choosing the lastest version is best. The latest version right now is Beta 1.0, although the latest version will always be in a folder called 'latest', alongside a folder with the version name. 

There will be two releases in each. One called VERSION.js, and the other called VERSION-auto.js

The 'auto' version is simply one where it will automatically ask you to import a database when you activate the bookmark. This may save you time depending on your workflow.

For installation instructions, go to INSTALL.txt on the root directory.
For usage information, go to USAGE.txt on the root directory.
