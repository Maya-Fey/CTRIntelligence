To use the TRC CounterIntelligence Suite, activate the bookmark on any /r/politics topic page. Alternatively, this application can be used on other subs. 

The TRC CounterIntelligence Suite has the capability to:

	- Track possible shills
	- Mark poorly sourced links
	- Categorize the pro hillary spam

To use the shill tracking feature, find a possible shill suspect, and click the "Add Untrusted/Suspected User" button on the TRC CounterIntelligence Menu. Paste or type in the name without and /u/ or /user/ or whatever prefixes and click OK. All posts from that user will now have their username on the second line highlighted red and with a '*'. If a shill is exonerated and you know they are innocent you can remove them from the suspects list by finding them on the dropdown menu under the add button and clicking "Remove Innocent from Suspect List". Posts from that person will no longer recieve special treatment.

To use the poor sourcing feature, click "Add new Bad Source" and enter in a source which you think is considerably poor (such as the daily mail). Click OK and all the posts with that as the domain will have that domain highlighted with red. If you change your mind about a source you can select it on the dropdown below the add button and click "Remove Source from Blacklist"
