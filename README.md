The TRC CounterIntelligence Suite is a JavaScript bookmarklet built for the precise reason of categorizing the shilling on /r/politics. It can probably be used on other subs but all sorts of undefined behavior may occur as a result. As of right now it CAN NOT be used on comment sections. It WILL fail completely and probably cause errors on your page. 

The TRC CounterIntelligence Suite was programmed by MayaFey_ (/u/MayaFey_). Free the Burgers.

Right now the TRC CounterIntelligence Suite is capable of:

	- Tracking shills 
	- Tracking shittily sourced links
	- Categorizing posts
	- Sharing your suspects with others

TO INSTALL:

COMPATIBILITY
