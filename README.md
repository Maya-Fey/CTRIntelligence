The TRC CounterIntelligence Suite is a JavaScript bookmarklet built for the precise reason of categorizing the shilling on /r/politics. It can also be used on other subs for more shill tracking (Though the CSS might look a bit odd on some subs...). As of right now it CAN NOT be used on comment sections. It WILL fail completely and probably cause errors on your page. 

The TRC CounterIntelligence Suite was programmed by MayaFey_ (/u/MayaFey_). Free the Burgers.

Right now the TRC CounterIntelligence Suite is capable of:

	- Tracking shills 
	- Tracking shittily sourced links
	- Categorizing posts
	- Sharing your suspects with others

COMPATIBILITY

This bookmarklet was designed to run and tested exclusively with Mozilla Firefox. If it doesn't work on other browsers that is unfortunate but not unexpected.
